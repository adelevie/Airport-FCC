# FCC Airport Database Import Program

This MapBasic program was written to import the Commission's Airport Database found at [http://www.fcc.gov/wtb/databases.html](http://www.fcc.gov/wtb/databases.html) or directly [ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/XFS_AlphaTest/zipped/airport.zip](ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/XFS_AlphaTest/zipped/airport.zip).
